# Sanke

This is an absolute of a nightmare JavaScript adaptation of the snake game. Now it have a fancy intro, and it stores your highest score

## Getting Started

If you want, to harm your eyes a little, you just have to download one of the two versions of the game to play. One is in Spanish and the other in English. Descompress it and open the HTML **called index.html**

### Prerequisites

You just need an Web Browser compatible with ES6, cause the code have some Arrow Functions. Some browsers that support the ES6 standard are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Brave... ***IT DOESN´T WORK ON MOBILE***

## Deployment

If you want to deploy this on a localhost server, you have to copy-paste the project into the htdocs folder in the XAMMP folder. Turn on the Apache server **(be sure to have the 80 and 443 ports open)**. Then write in the browser localhost/Sanke/index.html

## Built With

* VS Code - IDE used
* HTML5 - To deploy it on a Web Browser
* CSS3 - For the page to have styles, the animations, and so you can actually see the snake
* JS - For the game itself

## Contributing

I mean if you have a really really good idea open an issue, but doing after doing the intro and more. If you give some documentation to implement the idea, I probably will do it

## Versioning

I used GIT. It was a big relief being able to use a remote repository so, I don't lose my code.

## To keep in Mind

* I`m learning
* Don't expect a revolutionary gameplay cause you won't find it
* If you want to play a better version of snake you can always search Snake in Google and you will find a million times better [version](https://www.google.com/search?q=snake). I still prefer my version to be honest
* __The english version of the code doesn't change the name of the variables and the IDs, cause it gives me more work than commenting well the code. I am going to do this so english-speaking people can understand well-enough my code.__ If you're asking why the code is in Spanish is because I'm from Spain ¿okay?, and the S isn't silent. To prove that I'm from Spain -> ññññññññññ (I mean you can still do [Alt Gr+4]+n and it stills pop up, but you going to have to believe me)

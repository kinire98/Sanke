# Sanke

This is an absolute of a nightmare JavaScript adaptation of the snake game

## Getting Started

If you want, to harm your eyes a little, you just have to download one of the two versions of the game to play. One is in Spanish and the other in English. Descompress it, open the HTML **called index.html**

### Prerequisites

You just need an Web Browser compatible with ES6, cause the code have some Arrow Functions. Some browsers that support the ES6 standard are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Brave... ***IT DOESN´T WORK ON MOBILE***

## Deployment

If you want to deploy this on a localhost server, you have to copy-paste the project into the htdocs folder in the XAMMP folder. Turn on the Apache server **(be sure to have the 80 and 443 ports open)**. Then write in the browser localhost/Sanke/index.html

## Built With

* VS Code - IDE used
* HTML5 - To deploy it on a Web Browser
* CSS3 - For the page to have styles, and you can actually see the snake
* JS - For the game itself

## Contributing

I'm NOT open to contributions. It's a personal proyect made when I was 16, and to learn and make myself easier to find a job in the future. If you want to change something, feel free to do so.

## Versioning

I used GIT. Being honest with you, I still used commenting out blocks of code. Either way, I used Git so I can use GitHub, save my project on the cloud and more people could see my project.

## To keep in Mind

* I have no clue on how to do anything. I´m learning
* I did my best to make the game run as smoothly as possible
* That being said, maybe (only maybe) the game is unoptimised as hell and you may experience some lag specially, when the area of play is big or the snake is becoming bigger
* I know, it´s snake, but try running like 3 or 4 loops that have to do more iterations as the sanke grows, like 10 times per second or even more
* Don`t get me wrong, a big part of the code is asynchronous non-bloqueant (I don´t know if it´s written like that), so the performance doesn´t suffer as much.
* I swear I did my best :)
* Please keep in mind that I made this being 16 and still learning. I´m far from being a software enginner or something like that. I did this because I enjoy doing this.
* I hope you enjoy this, as far as you can enjoy a browser rip-off of snake.
* I you are wondering the name Sanke, came from a Typo, I liked the name and stayed like that
* Again, I hope you enjoy this as much I enjoyed developing
* __The english version of the code doesn't change the name of the variables and the IDs, cause it gives me more work than commenting well the code. I am going to do this so english-speaking people can understand well-enough my code.__ If you're asking why the code is in Spanish is because I'm from Spain ¿okay?, and the S isn't silent. To prove that I'm from Spain -> ññññññññññ
